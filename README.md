This is a curated list of **academic** (!) books and papers on
object-oriented programming, which promote "object thinking."
We are looking for papers that go along or disagree with the following
hypothesis from [Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html)
book series:

  * Objects are not data containers
  * NULL is evil
  * Static methods are evil
  * Implementation inheritance is evil
  * Type casting is evil
  * Reflection is evil
  * Java annotations are evil
  * Constructors must be code free
  * Objects must be immutable
  * Interfaces must be small
  * Getters and setters are evil

Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing.
**A behavioral notion of subtyping**.
_ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems_, 16 (6) (November 1994), 1811â€“1841.
